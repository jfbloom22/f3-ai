### History of F3 Nation

F3 Nation was founded on **January 1, 2011**, in Charlotte, North Carolina, by two friends, **David Redding (Dredd)** and **Tim Whitmire (OBT)**. They aimed to create a workout group for men that emphasized not only physical fitness but also camaraderie and leadership development. The inspiration came from their own experiences in boot camp-style workouts, which they wanted to extend to other men. Their vision was to offer men the opportunity to improve their fitness, foster meaningful relationships, and develop leadership skills.

Initially a local endeavor, F3 quickly grew into a national movement. Today, F3 Nation operates in **over 48 states** and offers **3,400+ workouts per week** globally. 

The peer-led leadership model has enabled F3's rapid expansion. Each participant is encouraged to lead workouts, fostering a community of accountability and shared leadership. Additionally, participants adopt nicknames, creating a sense of fun and inclusiveness for new members.

Beyond physical fitness, F3 has had a broader impact through charity and community service. For example, the **F3 Naperville** region has raised significant funds for non-profit organizations and organized community service projects, engaging both participants and their families.

Today, F3 is more than just a workout—it’s a movement that encourages **male community leadership** by providing men with the tools to improve themselves and serve their communities.
